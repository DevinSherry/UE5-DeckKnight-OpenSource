/**
 * @class UDeckData
 * @brief A data class that provides representation and handling of deck-related data within the context of the GAS Course project.
 *
 * UDeckData serves as a UObject-based class for encapsulating all deck-related information and functionality.
 * This class is designed to be extended or utilized wherever deck-specific data management is required.
 *
 * It is part of the GAS Course API and functions as a modular unit for handling deck logic, enabling clear,
 * organized, and scalable implementation of card or deck mechanics.
 *
 * @note This class is intended to work within Unreal Engine's UObject system and follows its lifecycle and design paradigms.
